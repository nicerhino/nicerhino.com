# nicerhino.com

Public website

## Development

This is a NextJS-powered site. To get started, you'll need a copy of NodeJS, which you can install with the Node Version Manager (NVM):

```bash
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
$ nvm install node
```

Now clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nicerhino/nicerhino.com
$ cd nicerhino.com
```

Finally, install the project dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

You should now have a local webserver running the website at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
